<h1>About the Author</h1>
<br>
<p>
Robin is a current student attending American Public University System in a Bachelor's Degree program for Digital Technology/Web Development.
She also is an avid volunteer citizen scientist and wildlife photographer who enjoys learning about animal species and assisting conservation efforts through photography and cinema work.
While working with MSU <a href="https://msu.edu/" target="_blank">(Michigan State University)</a> as a volunteer and member of interconnected organizations partnering with MSU, including VPP <a href="https://vernal-pool-patrol-mnfi.hub.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">(Vernal Pool Patrol)</a>, MNA <a href="https://michigannature.iescentral.com/" target="_blank">(Michigan Nature Association)</a> and MNFI <a href="https://mnfi.anr.msu.edu/" target="_blank">(Michigan Natural Features Inventory)</a>, she was asked to photograph Dragonfly and Damselfly larvae and adults. 
Researching different species and their conservation statuses on MNFI, she came across the Hine's Emerald Dragonfly on MNFI's list of <a href="https://mnfi.anr.msu.edu/species/animals" target="_blank">endangered species</a>.
She has yet to find an Emerald Dragonfly to photograph and report observations to MNFI.
